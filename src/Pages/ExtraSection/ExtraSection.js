        Why should you choose me as your Career Coach?
      </h1>

        "Over the years, I have acquired relevant skills and experience, which I
        shall bring to your career. I always feel that this question entails a
        list of my qualities that the interviewer wants me to speak out, and
        THAT makes the situation really awkward! On the other hand, I am a self
        motivated person and I try to exceed my superiorâ€™s expectations with
        high-quality work. Being a fast learner, I quickly pick up business
        knowledge related to my project. I have also worked tirelessly on my
        communication abilities and teamwork skills, which I will put to use in
        my future career, which would be in your career if I am selected for
        your betterment."
